# Integrated Retail Analytics System

**End-to-End Data Analytics and Intelligence Platform for Retail Business Optimization**
Built using data engineering, analytics pipelines, business intelligence logic, and integrated data modeling.

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a **comprehensive retail analytics system** that integrates multiple data sources to generate actionable business intelligence for retail operations.

The system is designed as a **full analytics pipeline**, covering:

* Data ingestion
* Data integration
* Data cleaning
* Feature engineering
* Analytical modeling
* Business KPI generation
* Insight extraction
* Decision-support analytics

This is not a single-notebook analysis — it is a **structured analytics system** representing a real-world retail intelligence platform.

---

## Problem Statement

Retail businesses face challenges such as:

* Fragmented data sources
* Poor data integration
* Limited visibility into operations
* Reactive decision-making
* Inefficient inventory management
* Revenue leakage
* Customer behavior uncertainty

This system enables **integrated retail intelligence** by unifying data into a single analytical framework for proactive business decisions.
